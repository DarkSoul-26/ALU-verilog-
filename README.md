# ALU-verilog-
A 32-bit ALU designed in Verilog performs arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shifts based on a 4-bit control input. It outputs a 32-bit result and a zero flag, making it suitable for FPGA or processor-based applications.

# ALU Vivado Project

Welcome! This repository contains a **32-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) project** implemented in **Verilog** using **Xilinx Vivado**.  

This project is designed to help you **learn, simulate, and experiment with basic digital logic operations**. Whether you’re a student, hobbyist, or engineer, you can explore the code and try it out on your own FPGA setup.

## Contents

- `alu.xpr` – The Vivado project file to open in Vivado.  
- `alu.srcs/` – Contains all the **Verilog source files** for the ALU.  
- `.gitignore` – Ensures temporary and generated files are not pushed to GitHub.
